# ShoeCraft
ShoeCraft is a blocky-texture like Minecraft game that I wrote in Pure vanilla JavaScript. This is just a template, feel free to clone and fix it up as you want. Although this is a solid starter, I did not go out of my way to make it *perfect*. I mentioned a few bugs that I thought should be recognized.

### Mentionable Current Bugs:
_____________________________

• Transparent Floor glitch

• Jump glitch - You basically sometimes jump insanely high for no reason lol

• Voxel Importing glitch

• Low FPS Rendering

• Controls Stop Working

• Sky and "Walls" Uneven - I messed up the sky textures/drawings

• Client Spawns in Air

• Mountain Fog glitch


### Example Gameplay:

I apologize in advance for any trouble you may have with this, I whiped this up in about 3 days so it's not perfect.

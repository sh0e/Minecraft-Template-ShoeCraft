# ShoeCraft
ShoeCraft is a blocky-texture like game similar to Minecraft that I wrote in pure vanilla JavaScript. This is just a template so it is not *perfect*, feel free to clone and add whatever you want to it. Although this is solid for the most part, there are a few bugs that I feel should be recognized.


### Current Bugs:

• FPS Voxel Rendering

• Jump glitch - Basically you randomly jump super high for no reason lol

• Transparent Voxels

• Uneven Textures/Sky - I messed up the sky textures/drawings

• Client spawns in sky


There may be more that I have not found yet ^

Please let me know any inconviences you may have while using this template, I whipped this out in about 3 days so it's not perfect.

### Example Gameplay:
